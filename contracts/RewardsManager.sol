    // NOTE ABOUT ARCHITECTURE
    // This contract is fundamentally tracking the balances on all vaults for all users
    // This basically means we have duplicated logic, we could do without by simply adding this to the vault
    // Adding it may also allow to solve Yield Theft issues as we're accounting for value * time as a way to reward more fairly
    // NOTE: Pool Together has 100% gone through these ideas, we have 4 public audits to read through
    // CREDIT: Most of the code is inspired by:
    // AAVE STAKE V2
    // COMPOUND
    // INVERSE.FINANCE Dividend Token
    // Pool Together V4


    // Invariant for deposits
    // If you had X token at epoch N, you'll have X tokens at epoch N+1
    // Total supply may be different
    // However, we calculate your share by just multiplying the share * secodns in theb vault
    // If you had X tokens a epoch N, and you had X tokens at epoch N+1
    // You'll get N + 1 * SECONDS_PER_EPOCH points in epoch N+1 if you redeem at N+2
    // If you have X tokens at epoch N and withdraw, you'll get TIME_IN_EPOCH * X points


    // MAIN ISSUE
    // You'd need to accrue every single user to make sure that everyone get's the fair share
    // Alternatively you'd need to calcualate each share on each block
    // The alternative would be to check the vault.totalSupply()
    // However note that will change (can change at any time in any magnitude)
    // and as such cannot be trusted as much
    // NOTE: That the invariant for deposits works also for totalSupply


    // If totalSupply was X tokens at epoch N, and nothing changes in epoch N+1
    // Then in epoch N+1 the totalSupply was the same as in epoch N
    // If that's the case
    // and we accrue on every account change
    // then all we gotta do is take totalSupply * lastAccrue amount and that should net us the totalPoints per epoch
    // Remaining, non accrued users, have to be accrued without increasing the totalPoints as they are already accounted for in the totalSupply * time
    

    // If the invariant that shares at x are the same as shares at n+1
    // And we accrue users on any shares changes
    // Then we do not need
